### R4DS
#### Chapter 5
This chapter is about data transformation that means bringing the data in shape for the analysis.

### Having a look on the data frame

Instead of looking at the whole data frame view(<dataframe>) we can present a tibble of the dataframe by typing <dataframe> into the console that shows the classifications of the different variable types.

### Dplyr

Dplyr's main manipulation commands are:

- filter() : filter data for certain values
- arrange() : reorder
- select() : filters data 
- mutate () ) 
- summarise ()
