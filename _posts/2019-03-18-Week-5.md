### INTS
#### Chapter 10 (Statistical Power)
This chapter introduced the concept of statistical power. Instead of thinking of effect size, this concept turns the question in another direction. Here we are much more intersted in what is the chance our experiment will find an effect of a particular size, *if* it exists. 

In terms of statistical language we care about the correct propability of rejections of H0's when the effect size is true. Whereas the Beta-error indicates the propability of *not* rejecting a H0 altough it is through, the power is the oposite (i.e. 1-Beta).
