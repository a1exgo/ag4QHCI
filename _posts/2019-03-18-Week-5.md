### INTS
#### Chapter 10 (Statistical Power)
This chapter introduced the concept of statistical power. Instead of thinking of effect size, this concept turns the question in another direction. Here we are much more intersted in what is the chance our experiment will find an effect of a particular size, *if* it exists. 

In terms of statistical language we care about the correct propability of rejections of H0's when the effect size is true. Whereas the Beta error (or Type II error) indicates the propability of *not* rejecting a H0 altough it is through, the power is the oposite (i.e. 1-Beta).


As the rejection of H0 depends on H1. We need to focus on the determinants that influence hypothesis testing (figures in the formula) in order to calculate the statistical power, i.e. power depends on:

- the design, for example independent groups
- chosen α, e.g. .05 (Lower α means it’s harder to reject H0, so more misses (Type II errors) and lower power)
- target effect size, e.g. δ = 0.5 (Larger δ gives higher power, sometimes dramatically higher.)
- N, the size of each group. (Larger N gives higher power.)
