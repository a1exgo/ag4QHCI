### R4DS
#### Chapter 14 (Strings)
This chapter shows regular expressions, or regexps for short. Regexps are a concise language for describing patterns in strings. Package prerequisites are tidyverse and stringr.

- A basic string is created with
```
string <- 'Write something that is a string'
```
- After, we can show the string by tiping in the variable or just the content of the string with 
```
writelines(string)
```
This is helpful for testing a whether a special character (mostly a ' or ") is correctly set in the string. Escapes can be inserted as backslashs `\'`.

**Use of stringr basics**
By typing str_ a bunch of possible commands are presented, e.g.:
- Get length of a string (here, it's 32):
```
stringr::str_length(string)
```
- Combine two+ exisisting strings:
```
string1 <- 'Test'
stringr::str_c(string,string1)
[1] "Write something that is a stringTest"
```
- Subsetting strings (meaning that we only take parts of a string depending on the position related to the start or the end of the string:
```
stringr::str_sub(x, <start_of_subset>, <endofsubset>)
```
   - It is also possible to put a minus sign before `<start_of_subset>` or `<endofsubset>`. Like this, the count is 'mirrored'             from the latter to the previous part of the string.

- Matching patterns with regexps
  Weâ€™ll use str_view() and str_view_all(). These functions take a character vector and a regular expression, and show you how     they match.
```
stringr::str_view(x, "<searched_string")
```
   - Anchor are possible to look for a certain string pattern at the beginning or the end of a string with:
   ```
   str_view(<variable_name_of_string>, "^a$")
   ```
   If the `^`is set 'a' in the beginning of a string is searched, and if `$` is set, a 'a' at the end of a string is searched.
