### R4DS
#### Chapter 14 (Strings)
This chapter shows regular expressions, or regexps for short. Regexps are a concise language for describing patterns in strings. Package prerequisites are tidyverse and stringr.

A basic string is created with
```
string <- 'Write something that is a string'
```
After, we can show the string by tiping in the variable or just the content of the string with 
```
writelines(string)
