This blog features different 'categories' of content from the lecture Quantitative Methods in Human-Computer Interaction with Chat Wacharamanotham at the University of Zurich.

Every post relates to the chronological position of the week within the course ={1,..,14} and contains the following categories:

# R4DS
stands for the online textbook 'R for Data Science' (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) and documents the use of R for the use of data visualisation and analysis.
# INTS
stands for 'Introduction to the New Statistics' by Cumming & Calin-Jageman (2017)
# Class 
classifies snippets, insight os similar from the lecture (including lecture slides) by Chat.
# Project
Any interesting insight or discussion on the project we thought on will be documented in this category of posts.

Please note that some cateogires may coinside in a weekly post (at the moment - could change in the future)

In order to look at a project that has a vivid experiment, I'd like to think of Ronald Fisher, who said:
> "To call in the statistician after the experiment is done may be no more than asking him to perform a post-mortem examination: he may be able to say what the experiment died of."
