### R4DS 
#### Chapter 4
Apparently R has built-in functions, e.g.
```
seq()
``` 

#### Chapter 6
I should not include 
```
install.package()
```
in my code (as it is antisocial. :))

#### Chapter 8
Key take aways:
- Create an RStudio project for each data analysis project.
- Keep data files there; weâ€™ll talk about loading them into R in data import.
